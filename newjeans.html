                NewJeans is a five member group under HYBE Entertainment, with ADOR being the sub-company handling all management surrounding the group's activities.
                Standing for "All Doors, One Room", ADOR was founded in 2021 and NewJeans was finalized as a group in early 2022. Their summer debut was highly anticipated, as HYBE is well known for debuting the biggest K-pop group in the world: BTS.
                Their debut album contained 3 title tracks: "Attention", "Hype Boy", and "Cookie". Hype Boy reached #1 on several music charts domestically in South Korea, and charted worldwide on Apple Music and Spotify as well.

                One thing about NewJeans that made them stand out was their distinct style and way they marketed themselves as a group.
                There was minimal hype and advertising prefacing their debut, and they dropped their first music video, "Attention", with no teasers to inform viewers when it would be released.
                The very next day, they released an intro video for their second song, "Hype Boy", which introduced the members' names and led viewers to four seperate music videos linked at the end of the intro video.
                ADOR continued by released the "Hurt" music video two days later, and the group revealed on Tiktok and Instagram that their debut would be coming August 1st, 2022, with their song "Cookie".
                All four music videos had a distinct chill and fresh summer vibe to them that was unique to the current high-energy EDM that was on the rise in the K-pop world since 2019.
