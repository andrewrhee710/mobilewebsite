            <p>
                IVE is a five member group under Starship Entertainment. Debuting in December 2021 with their hit single, "Eleven", the group is known for their upbeat party bops that discuss the wonders of love.
                Two members, Wonyoung and Yujin, are from a previous group IZ*ONE. IZ*ONE was a temporary group that was immensly popular, which contributed to IVE's popularity as they had members from a popular group.
                Their three singles so far, "Eleven", "Love Dive", and "After Like" have all charted high domestically and internationally, and they have won several music shows as well.

                The surrounding hype from rumors of former IZ*ONE members debuting again created most of the hype surrounding IVE before their debut. However, listeners quickly realized that the group didn't need to rely on past popularity to boost their group's reputation.
                From their first single, it was clear that IVE was bringing a new sound to girl groups. Deeper, slower beats with smooth voices highlighted their debut and their first comeback.
                For their summer comeback, word circulated that their company had bought a sample of the well-known hit, "I Will Survive" by Gloria Gaynor. Their single "After Like" took advantage of the catchy backbeat to create a song that listeners around the world loved.
